- DdzServer unit tests for code so far
  - Basic logic: creation of game state, event firing, event listeners, turn timeouts
  - Auctioning logic: Skipping passed players, max bid storage, bid validation, turn timeout logic, phase advancement/landlord assignment/remaining deck dealing
- Implement DdzServer play phase - current hand type validation, advancement of play, win condition
- Tests for DdzServer play phase
- Environment tests for DdzServer - node and browser
- Main splash screen for site - choose your mode "local" or "online" (latter coming soon)
  - Might need router for this as now have 3 pages - splash, local (SPA), online (SPA)
- "local" mode implementation (pass-the-phone style game)
  - Just needs a DdzServer, no WebRTC clients etc.
  - Try to make components semi-reusable for online version
  - Transition screens - "Pass the phone to XXX [Confirm ->]" to avoid hand-spying
