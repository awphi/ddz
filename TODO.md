- Implement DdzServer score ledger
  - Keep track of who owes who how much based on scoring rules
- Tests for score ledger
- Environment tests for DdzServer - node and browser
- Main splash screen for site - choose your mode "local" or "online" (latter coming soon)
  - Might need router for this as now have 3 pages - splash, local (SPA), online (SPA)
- "local" mode implementation (pass-the-phone style game)
  - Just needs a DdzServer, no WebRTC clients etc.
  - Try to make components semi-reusable for online version
  - Transition screens - "Pass the phone to XXX [Confirm ->]" to avoid hand-spying
  - Motion for neat animations - e.g. use layout animation to move cards from hand, to center, to discard deck as needed
- Setup GH action to deploy app via vercel
- Setup GH action for publishing lib (trigger on merge to main)
- Add links & status/version banners of deployments to READMEs
